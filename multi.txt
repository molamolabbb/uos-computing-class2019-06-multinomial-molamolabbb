reference[0] : 0.666667 
reference[2] : 0.953333

We get high accuracy.(data 01,02,20,21)
But, in multi-accuracy, it doesn't.
If we choose the data 2 as reference, we can get the higher multi-accuracy.
But choosing 0, we can get the lower multi-accuracy.

First, choosing 2, we aren’t well-known correlation with 0 and 1. 
Choosing 0, we aren’t well-known correlation with the other datas.
Therefore, it is important to choose the reference.
